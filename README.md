This is a simple chess engine made to play with people using the same computer(locally) using godot.
Features in this engine. 
Highlights move you can make with each piece.
Can castle and en passent.
Made using only gd script.
Can change board size using slider.

Have not implemented checks or checkmate or pawn promotion but this is much more of an improvement to the example chess project in godot. This looks much nicer aswell.
